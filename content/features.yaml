  action: Step Aboard!
  body: Our very first web app used daily throughout DGS-1, DGS-4 and DGS-5. TBP is a community-maintained portal that allows immediate, workstation-agnostic mission setup and resource sharing. It is definitely NOT designed for mobile users.

  action: Step Aboard!
  body: Although it has since been subsumed by Unicorn, Fritz was a JPEG renaming tool that slashed a tedious, 40-minute product conversion process to a few clicks and a couple minutes.

  action: Go forth!
  body: Coming Soon! Our vision is to sharpen mission competency by providing convient and informative training program automation. We want to revitalize this archaic AF training program with some modern jazz. I can neither confirm or deny if this will be designed for mobile users... probably not though.

  title: Turbine
  action: Go for a spin!
  body: Our squadron management tool training app. We train our engineers with several variations of tech stacks and progressive mock stories to develop small incremental slices of each feature. Some of this looks good on mobile but it was totally accidental.

  title: DotVoter
  action: Play your Card!
  body: A very primative app made for fun with a simple login and cards you can vote on. We just used it to explore Apollo and Graphql.  Mobile users, I know you are reading this... just don't. It looks so bad it will brick your phone.
